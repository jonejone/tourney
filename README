Tourney
=======

Tourney is a BSD-licensed Django project that hosts websites for disc golf tournaments. The application lets a user create a new tournament, fully manage everything with regards to registration, when registration opens and so on, waiting lists, sending out emails with payment information and a lot more.

It is currently deployed on Heroku on disctourney.com, where it hosts a few Norwegian disc golf tournaments. The project comes packaged so it is easily deployable to Heroku (and other environments).

Feel free to fork and create pull requests if you have any suggestions to improvements!
